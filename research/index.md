##The Chen lab uses innovative genetics and genomics, single cell omics, computational, and imaging tools to understand the connection between genetic variants and human diseases, using the visual system as the model.

We pursue these goals in the following areas:
Identify genes and mutations underlying human diseases.
Systematically predict and assess the function consequence of genetic variants across the genome.
Investigate the changes in transcriptome and epigenome during development and under disease condition at single-cell resolution.
Develop novel therapeutics, including gene therapy, genome editing, and neural regeneration, for treating the diseases.
